# PCB-designs

The story is about a man who has a degree in electronics engineering and design. He designs PCBs for a line following robot, an arduino training kit and a ticket machine that he can send to be manufactured for future global development.

The person learns all about electronics from his mentor who tries to keep the knowledge of how they work to himself so he can learn too. He starts off by reading diagrams from books and then eventually builds his own version of the arduino robot. He starts making YouTube videos but is not very successful. 

However, he tries... tries...
